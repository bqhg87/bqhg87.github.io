          <p>Conspiracy theories have existed for centuries, but in the digital age, they spread faster than ever. Echo Grove explores some of the most well-known physics-related conspiracies, including fears about 5G radiation, the Large Hadron Collider creating black holes, gamma ray bursts, HAARP controlling the weather, quantum healing devices, the dangers of nuclear power, and microwave ovens emitting harmful radiation. <br><br> Players will encounter conspiracy theorists, sceptical scientists, and conflicting narratives, choosing to uncover the scientific truth or fuel public paranoia.<br>We created this game to address the misuse of physics in conspiracy theories. Scientific concepts are often misunderstood, exaggerated, or deliberately distorted to create fear and distrust. By placing players in these scenarios, we aim to demonstrate how misinformation spreads and how scientific literacy can challenge it.<br><br> We are a group of Durham University students passionate about science communication and critical thinking. Through this game, we want to highlight the importance of questioning sources, understanding real physics, and recognising how conspiracy theories manipulate information. The world of science is full of incredible discoveries, but separating fact from fiction has never been more important.<br><br> We hope you enjoy the game!</p>

          <p>This game was created as part of the Digital Media Project component of the Physics in Society module at Durham University. Our goal was to educate the general public on the misuse of physics in an engaging and accessible way. We hope you've learned more about how physics can be misrepresented and the impact of these misconceptions.</p>

          <p>Quantum healing is a pseudoscience that uses and misinterprets the principles of quantum physics in order to promote supposed healing properties. Most - if not all - examples of this misuse of physics involve the spread of mis/disinformation for monetary gain - a motivation common in the spread of false information <sup><a href="https://post.parliament.uk/research-briefings/post-pn-0719/" title="https://post.parliament.uk/research-briefings/post-pn-0719/" target="blank" >[1]</a></sup>. <br><br>
          Widely shared across social media, quantum healing is purported as a miracle cure to many illnesses, including serious life-altering conditions such as chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia <sup><a href="https://www.facebook.com/AmandaIntuitiveConsultant" title="https://www.facebook.com/AmandaIntuitiveConsultant" target="blank" >[2]</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sarah.a.wilson.79" title="https://www.facebook.com/sarah.a.wilson.79" target="blank" >[3]</a></sup>.

These convoluted sentences draw on real physics principles of quantum entanglement, scalar fields and energy, and they can be filled with scientific jargon that will often have no meaning to anybody that is not familiar with the physics, meaning that it is incredibly easy to assume that these descriptions can be trusted.

          Quantum mechanics refers to a branch of physics that deals with the interactions of matter and light on atomic and subatomic scales. These interactions don't follow the rules of most interactions between objects, which is usually known as 'classical mechanics'. This means that, in contrast, quantum mechanics is quite counterintuitive in comparison to our everyday classical physics. Whilst this means quantum mechanics can seem quite magical, it is in fact heavily backed by many peer-reviewed studies and is well documented and understood.</p>

          <h2>Energy:</h2> <br>
          <p>Many quantum healers claim that wave-particle duality demonstrates the interconnection between matter and energy, linking this directly to healing that is said to result from influencing the 'energy field' of the body <sup><a href="https://www.quantumenergyhealing.co.uk/" title="https://www.quantumenergyhealing.co.uk/" target="blank" >[1]</a><a href="https://www.quantumenergyhealing.co.uk/" title="https://www.quantumenergyhealing.co.uk/" target="blank" >[2]</a><a href="https://drlodayahospital.com/blogs/quantum-healing-benefits-risks/" title="https://drlodayahospital.com/blogs/quantum-healing-benefits-risks/" target="blank" >[3]</a></sup>.

          <h2>Entanglement:</h2>
          <p>'Quantum entanglement' is a word full of physics jargon that can sound incredibly complicated, and simple explanations of this phenomenon can sound very convincing, even when they are incorrect. Contrary to some views <sup><a href="https://www.prittieyoga.co.uk/blog2024/what-is-quantum-healing" title="https://www.prittieyoga.co.uk/blog2024/what-is-quantum-healing" target="blank" >[5]</a></sup>, quantum entanglement does not provide any proof of shared consciousness or an ability to unlock your own consciousness - it instead describes the relationship between two particles, where changes to one can affect the other.<br>Whilst applying these principles to health and healing can sound promising, it is unfortunately not a real application of quantum physics, and the suggestion that every conceivable thing in the universe - including our body and our consciousness - is interconnected is unfortunately false <sup><a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevphyseducres.20.020145" title="https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevphyseducres.20.020145" target="blank" >[4]</a></sup>.</p>

        <div class="articleItem wide">
          <h2>Observer Effect:</h2> <br>
          <p>Proponents of quantum healing also often refer to the observer effect <sup><a href="https://www.prittieyoga.co.uk/blog2024/what-is-quantum-healing" title="https://www.prittieyoga.co.uk/blog2024/what-is-quantum-healing" target="blank" >[5]</a></sup> - which is the idea that in quantum physics, observing or measuring something can actually change it, because there is no way to measure something without affecting it. To understand this, imagine checking the pressure of a bike tyre - when you attach the pressure gauge, some air escapes, meaning you've changed the amount of air in the tyre simply by measuring it. This effect is true even on the quantum level, but some people believe that this implies our intentions shape our reality by directing energy, which is untrue. Reality cannot be determined by external human intervention <sup><a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevphyseducres.20.020145" title="https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevphyseducres.20.020145" target="blank" >[4]</a></sup>.</p>

          <p>Often, rather than presenting facts, writers frame their posts as questions. For instance, a post asking, "What's going on in Houston, Texas?" over an image that may otherwise not raise too many questions, but the presence of the question means it begins to seem suspicious. By not stating their own theories, they may aim to foster curiosity among those who are unfamiliar with the issue, while allowing the imaginations of those already engaged to run rampant.<br><br>
          Phrases such as "if you know... you know!" exploit human nature's tendency to fear exclusion. This approach creates an impression of an insider group, enticing individuals to explore further.<br><br>The inclusion of emojis in these posts can enhance relatability, with the 'thinking' emoji frequently used to project a sense of reliability—suggesting that the writer is engaging in critical thinking and thereby establishing trustworthiness.</p>

The ability to search for terms like "weather control" often yields numerous posts spreading misinformation, many of which feature little to no fact-checking. The influence that just a few similar searches can have on an individual's feed is concerning. One way to mitigate this effect is to periodically log out of these platforms, open a private browsing window, and observe the content that appears without the constraints of the tunnel the algorithm creates.</p>

          <p>While there are claims regarding the potential harmful effects of using microwaves for cooking, numerous studies have demonstrated their safety. Not only do microwaves not remain in food, but they also cannot escape the microwave oven during operation. The typical wavelength of microwaves in consumer ovens is approximately 12.2 cm, which is significantly larger than the mesh covering the door that allows visibility of the food inside. This design ensures that microwaves cannot escape due to the metal surfaces surrounding them, resulting in minimal levels detectable outside the appliance, well below background levels.<br>Microwaves are a form of non-ionizing radiation. Although they can cause burns if directed at the skin, they do not have the capability to directly damage DNA within cells - the process that can lead to mutations and issues such as cancer. </p>

When individuals encounter a claim that cites a source, accompanied by a link, it can enhance their perception of the claim's legitimacy.

This strategy allows the creators of such content to cite sources that are unrelated to the topic at hand.

        <div class="articleItem wide">
          <p>Another technique involves leveraging respected figures within society to build trust in their assertions. For example, references to unnamed 'doctors' making claims, without providing further identification or context, can manipulate public perception.<br><br> Additionally, the use of scientific terminology, such as 'toxins' and 'carcinogens,' can exploit individuals' inherent fear of the unknown. If a person does not fully understand the terminology, they may be more susceptible to persuasion, especially as the source presents itself with confidence. Fearmongering regarding topics like 'colon cancer' further preys on concerns about carcinogens—of which many exist in varying degrees and are not entirely understood. This can lead individuals to seek information from confident sources, often overlooking more balanced and nuanced literature.</p>

        <p>The Chernobyl nuclear accident occurred in 1986, caused by a combination of faulty reactor design and poor personnel training. Following a shutdown test, one of the plant's reactors exploded, causing a major fire and releasing a significant amount of smoke, fission products and debris. The majority of the material was deposited near the site, but lighter fission products were carried northwest by the wind. The accident resulted in the largest uncontrolled release of radioactive material into the environment by a civilian operation ever recorded. Radioactive substances remained in the air for around 10 days, with Iodine-131 and Caesium-137 (two types of radioactive elements) contributing significantly to radiation doses.<br>In total, the accident killed 30 operators and firemen. 237 people onsite were diagnosed with acute radiation syndrome (ARS) and 28 died as a result <sup><a href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident" title="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident " target="blank" >[3]</a></sup>. The accident had long-term effects for many people in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine, most notably including thyroid cancer in children and leukaemia in the power plant's operators. The release and subsequent transport of radioactive material also had significant negative impacts on the environment, with radionuclides (elements that release radiation as they break down over time) subsequently found in wood, forest food products and freshwater fish, causing particularly significant damage to forests and fresh water bodies <sup><a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/EPRS_BRI(2016)581972" title="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/EPRS_BRI(2016)581972" target="blank" >[4]</a></sup>.

However, the arriving tsunami flooded the nearby sea wall and knocked out the emergency generators, preventing them from cooling the reactors<sup><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-56252695" title="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-56252695" target="blank" >[7]</a></sup>. The sheer heat still present in the reactors led to them overheating and partially melting - known as a nuclear meltdown - causing hydrogen and oxygen to combine and explode, releasing radioactive material into the atmosphere and ocean<sup><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-56252695" title="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-56252695" target="blank" >[7]</a><a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abi5976" title="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abi5976" target="blank" >[8]</a></sup>. 2,313 disaster-related deaths were recorded among earthquake, tsunami and nuclear evacuees from the area surrounding Fukushima, but only one of these was attributed to radiation <sup><a href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/fukushima-daiichi-accident#:~:text=Official%20figures%20show%20that%20there,by%20the%20earthquake%20or%20tsunami" title="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/fukushima-daiichi-accident#:~:text=Official%20figures%20show%20that%20there,by%20the%20earthquake%20or%20tsunami" target="blank" >[9]</a></sup>.

Whilst nuclear waste may be hazardous, most major industrial processes produce hazardous waste and less than 0.05% of all hazardous waste in the US results from nuclear power. Additionally, the transport of nuclear waste has never resulted in any radioactive release that has caused harm to people or the environment. The vast majority of nuclear waste only remains harmfully radioactive for a few tens of years, meaning it can easily be disposed of in near-surface underground facilities. Only about 3% of nuclear waste requires isolation for many thousands of years, and national regulations and international conventions, combined with technological developments and a multi-barrier approach, ensure that this waste is handled correctly and disposed of in a manner that secures its isolation and guarantees that it poses no risk to human health or to the environment<sup><a href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/nuclear-waste/radioactive-wastes-myths-and-realities" title="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/nuclear-waste/radioactive-wastes-myths-and-realities" target="blank" >[13]</a></sup>.</p>

          <p><br>One of the most feared of the hazards associated with nuclear power is ionising radiation. Radiation is a form of energy that travels as energised particles or electromagnetic waves. It is known as 'ionising' when it has sufficient energy to pull an electron away from its atom. Whilst 'ionising' is often thrown around like a scary word, it includes types of waves we hear about every day, such as X-rays<sup><a href="https://www.arpansa.gov.au/understanding-radiation/what-is-radiation/ionising-radiation" title="https://www.arpansa.gov.au/understanding-radiation/what-is-radiation/ionising-radiation" target="blank" >[14]</a></sup>. Like X-rays, all ionising radiation is dangerous, as it can cause cells to die or mutate, then leading to cancer<sup><a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-ionizing-radiation" title="https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-ionizing-radiation" target="blank" >[15]</a></sup>. Nuclear power plants naturally emit ionising radiation, but, like X-rays, barriers can protect against this radiation, and current protection standards for nuclear power plants are based on the idea that any exposure to radiation carries some risk, so all steps are taken to ensure that radiation exposure for power plant workers remains as low as possible and that exposure for local residents is almost zero<sup><a href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/nuclear-power-101" title="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/nuclear-power-101" target="blank" >[16]</a></sup>.</p>

          <p><br>As we move towards a low-carbon society, nuclear energy continues to emerge as an incredibly important form of sustainable, truly clean energy. Unlike wind, solar or tidal power, nuclear power production is not intermittent and can run 24/7, meaning that it is incredibly reliable [18], all while not releasing any carbon (unlike natural gas production). The sheer amount of energy produced by nuclear power plants means that one large plant can replace multiple coal plants, or smaller nuclear reactors could even be built on the site of old coal power plants, thereby reusing the land. Nuclear energy uses 46 times less land and 17 times less material than solar power in order to produce the same amount of energy and is the second safest source of energy in the world<sup><a href="https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/international-day-of-clean-energy-why-nuclear-power" title="https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/international-day-of-clean-energy-why-nuclear-power" target="blank" >[17]</a></sup>.

His repeated use of 'poisonous' and 'weaponry' implies situations of death and terror, and whilst nuclear power plants do use fission - the same process used in nuclear bombs - the production of nuclear weapons is in fact strictly controlled. Similarly, nuclear power plants operate with extremely strict safety controls that make nuclear power the second safest form of energy<sup><a href="https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/international-day-of-clean-energy-why-nuclear-power" title="https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/international-day-of-clean-energy-why-nuclear-power" target="blank" >[17]</a></sup>.

          <p>Many believe that gamma ray bursts (GRBs) may have triggered one or more extinction events, particularly the Ordovician extinction, during which marine species experienced a dramatic decline. Given this, it's understandable that there exists concerns regarding GRBs. However, there is no need for alarm.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="articleItem left">
        <p>Currently, Earth is protected by a layer of ozone situated 15-30km above the surface. A nearby GRB could potentially break down this layer, resulting in the formation of ground-level ozone. Nonetheless, even if the event were centered over the South Pole, where ozone depletion would be most concentrated, models indicate that surface ozone levels would peak at about 10 parts per billion. This level is significantly below the threshold of 30 parts per billion that would pose an increased risk of respiratory failure in humans or harm to vegetation.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="articleItem right">
        <p>One explanation for the belief that a GRB caused the Ordovician extinction relates to the water solubility of ozone. However, even if all the ozone produced were to dissolve, it is unlikely to have had more than a very minor effect on bacteria and fish larvae, suggesting it is improbable to have caused an extinction event in the past, or to cause one in the future.</p>

This layer serves as a protective shield against UV radiation, and its absence could lead to an increased risk of sunburn and DNA damage, similar to the effects observed in regions with a depleted ozone layer, such as parts of the southern hemisphere. Additionally, the presence of nitrous oxide in the atmosphere would reduce sunlight reaching the Earth's surface, potentially leading to global cooling, while nitric acid rain could adversely affect ecosystems. </p>

        <div class="articleItem wide">
            <p>There is evidence suggesting that a gamma ray burst may have impacted Earth in 774CE, as indicated by tree rings from that year, which exhibit carbon-14 levels approximately 20 times higher than normal, pointing to a GRB occurring within 13,000 light years. Despite this, humanity has persisted. Recent calculations propose that a GRB occurs close enough to affect Earth approximately every 5 million years. Given these findings and their realistic implications, it suggests that, even with some potential impacts, it is exceedingly unlikely to destroy life as we know it. </p>

          <p>Despite growing paranoia, the explanation is simple: some buildings' wiring picks up certain frequencies, creating an audio glitch. The hum has no connection to memory loss, plant health, or animal behaviour. Concerns about 5G have been widely studied, with no scientific evidence proving harm. The World Health Organization and other regulators confirm that 5G's non-ionising radiation lacks the energy to damage human cells or DNA. Its frequency range is similar to Wi-Fi and radio waves, which have been safely used for decades. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="articleItem wide">
          <p>Fears about 5G stem from misunderstandings about radio frequencies, much like past concerns over electricity and mobile phones. As shown in the game, misinformation thrives when new technology emerges, and unfamiliarity breeds fear. Understanding how 5G works helps separate fact from speculation.</p>

          <p>The game demonstrates how conspiracy theories shape public perception, even without evidence. Mervin refuses to accept the engineer's explanation, insisting the hum is part of something bigger. If players choose to publish his claims, paranoia spreads, showing how misinformation influences beliefs. In reality, false 5G claims led to vandalism and harassment during the COVID-19 pandemic, proving how difficult it is to correct misinformation once it takes hold. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="articleItem wide">
          <p>The game highlights how emotion often outweighs evidence, eroding trust in experts and affecting real-world issues like public health and climate change. Recognising how misinformation spreads is crucial to ensuring facts, not fear, shape our understanding. The hum was never a real threat, yet reactions to it mirror the dangers of misinformation. Conspiracy theories may seem harmless, but they spread fear, erode trust in science, and can lead to real-world harm. Understanding their influence helps us approach new information critically.</p>

          <p>Well done! You have saved Echo Grove from delusion by educating the townspeople on the misuses of physics that once plagued within their community.</p>
          <p>Thanks to your hard work and dedication, their fears about nuclear power, gamma ray bursts, weather control, microwaves and the Large Hadron Collider have been put to rest. You have educated them on the misconceptions surrounding quantum healing.</p>
          <p>The townsfolk now recognise how mis/disinformation and conspiracies theories exploit real physics principles and the motivations behind these actions. By relying on scientists, experts, books and peer-reviewed research, you have ensured that truth prevails over pseudoscience. </p>
          <p>Thank you for playing! Feel free to visit Echo Grove again or explore our informative articles on physics and the ways it can be misused any time you like!</p>
